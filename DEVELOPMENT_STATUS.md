# ETLA Platform Development Status

**Last Updated:** September 25, 2025  
**Current Phase:** ATS Core Module Development  
**Build Status:** Waiting for validation

## Branch Status

| Branch | Status | Description | Build Status |
|--------|--------|-------------|--------------|
| `main` | ‚úÖ Stable | Production baseline | ‚úÖ Passing |
| `feature/database-schema-discovery` | ‚úÖ Complete | Database analysis framework | ‚úÖ Pushed |
| `feature/reporting-enhancements` | ‚úÖ Complete | Enhanced reporting with branding | ‚úÖ Pushed |
| `feature/ats-core-module` | üîÑ In Progress | ATS dashboard and jobs | üîÑ Validating |

## Completed Features

### Phase 1: Database Schema Discovery ‚úÖ
- [x] Comprehensive schema discovery SQL script
- [x] Discovery report template
- [x] Database analysis framework
- [x] Preparation for existing schema analysis

### Phase 2: Reporting Enhancements ‚úÖ
- [x] **Branding Service** - Dynamic customer name resolution
- [x] **Export Utils** - CSV/XLSX export functionality with XLSX library
- [x] **Timecard Grid** - Daily breakdown with totals and export
- [x] **Enhanced Tax Records** - Local tax display with customer branding
- [x] **Employee Documents** - RBAC-enforced document management with preview

### Phase 3: ATS Core Module (Partial) üîÑ
- [x] **Talent Dashboard** - Metrics, recent activity, quick actions
- [x] **Jobs Management** - Job listing, filtering, search, status management
- [ ] **Pipeline/Kanban** - Application stage management (pending)
- [ ] **Candidates Management** - Candidate profiles and directory (pending)
- [ ] **Interview Scheduling** - Calendar integration and feedback (pending)
- [ ] **Offers Management** - Offer workflow and approvals (pending)

## Current Development Strategy

### Build Validation Approach
1. **Incremental Commits** - Small, focused commits for easier debugging
2. **Build Monitoring** - Wait for successful builds before continuing
3. **Error Resolution** - Fix TypeScript/build errors immediately
4. **Testing Integration** - Validate in Vercel before proceeding

### Next Steps (After Build Validation)
1. **Fix any build errors** in current ATS components
2. **Continue with Pipeline component** - Kanban board for application management
3. **Add Candidates management** - Profile system and directory
4. **Implement Interview system** - Scheduling and feedback collection
5. **Create Offers workflow** - Approval process and offer management

## Technical Dependencies

### Installed Packages
- `xlsx` - For Excel export functionality in reporting

### Required Integrations
- Supabase database connection
- Authentication context
- Tenant context for multi-tenant support
- RBAC permission system

## Known Issues & Considerations

### Build Monitoring
- Waiting for current build validation before proceeding
- TypeScript strict mode compliance required
- Component import/export consistency needed

### Database Schema
- Mock data currently used for development
- Real database integration pending schema discovery completion
- RLS policies need implementation for ATS tables

### UI/UX Consistency
- Following existing design system patterns
- Maintaining responsive design across all components
- Consistent error handling and loading states

## Risk Mitigation

### Build Failures
- **Strategy:** Incremental development with build validation
- **Action:** Fix issues immediately before adding new features

### Integration Complexity
- **Strategy:** Use existing patterns and services
- **Action:** Leverage established authentication and tenant systems

### Performance Considerations
- **Strategy:** Implement pagination and lazy loading
- **Action:** Monitor component performance and optimize as needed

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- ‚úÖ All builds passing
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compliance
- ‚úÖ Component reusability
- üîÑ Performance benchmarks (pending)

### Feature Completeness
- ‚úÖ Reporting enhancements (100%)
- üîÑ ATS core module (40% complete)
- ‚è≥ Questionnaire system (0% - Phase 4)
- ‚è≥ RBAC enhancements (0% - Phase 5)
- ‚è≥ Integration testing (0% - Phase 6)

## Communication Protocol

### Build Status Updates
- Monitor Vercel deployments for each push
- Report build failures immediately
- Wait for green builds before continuing development

### Code Quality Standards
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- ESLint/Prettier formatting
- Component documentation
- Error boundary implementation
