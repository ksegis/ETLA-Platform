# Talent Management Application Analysis

This document provides a detailed analysis of the current implementation of the talent management application, focusing on the features required for applicant tracking. The analysis is based on the review of `/frontend/src/app/talent/candidates/page.tsx` and `/frontend/src/components/ats/CandidatesManagement.tsx`.

## Feature Analysis

The following table outlines the status of each required feature:

| Feature | Implemented | Missing/Incomplete | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Applicant/Candidate ID | Yes | | The `id` field is present in the `Candidate` interface. |
| Full Name | Yes | | The `name` field is present in the `Candidate` interface. |
| Complete Address | No | Incomplete | The `location` field is a string, not a structured object with `street`, `city`, `state`, and `zip`. |
| Email Address | Yes | | The `email` field is present in the `Candidate` interface. |
| Phone Number | Yes | | The `phone` field is present in the `Candidate` interface. |
| Job Title Applied For | Yes | | The `title` field in the `Candidate` interface seems to represent the job title applied for. |
| Job Location | No | Missing | There is no field for the location of the job the candidate applied for. |
| Requisition ID/Description | No | Missing | There is no field for the requisition ID or a detailed description of the job. |
| Application Status | Yes | | The `status` field is present in the `Candidate` interface. |
| Attach Multiple Documents | No | Incomplete | The `resumeUrl` field only allows for a single document, and there is no mechanism for uploading or managing multiple file types. |

## Current Data Structure

The current data structure for a candidate is defined in the `Candidate` interface in both `page.tsx` and `CandidatesManagement.tsx`. The following is the interface from `page.tsx`:

```typescript
interface Candidate {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  phone: string;
  location: string;
  title: string;
  company: string;
  experience: string;
  expectedSalary: number;
  currentSalary: number;
  availability: string;
  status: string;
  rating: number;
  skills: string[];
  education: Array<{
    degree: string;
    school: string;
    year: string;
    gpa: string;
  }>;
  workHistory: Array<{
    title: string;
    company: string;
    duration: string;
    description: string;
  }>;
  certifications: string[];
  languages: string[];
  portfolio: string;
  github: string;
  linkedin: string;
  resumeUrl: string;
  notes: string;
  source: string;
  addedDate: string;
  lastContact: string;
  tags: string[];
}
```

## Recommendations for Improvement

To meet the required features, the following changes are recommended:

1.  **Update the `Candidate` interface** to include the missing and incomplete fields. The `location` field should be a structured object, and new fields for `jobLocation`, `requisitionId`, `requisitionDescription`, and `documents` should be added.
2.  **Implement a file upload and management system** to allow users to attach multiple documents of various types to a candidate's record.
3.  **Update the UI components** to display and edit the new fields.
4.  **Update the database schema** to reflect the changes in the `Candidate` interface.
